# Password manager

## Why?

Using a password manager offers several advantages:

1. **Strong Password Generation**: Password managers can create complex, unique passwords for each of your accounts, reducing the risk of password reuse.
2. **Convenience**: They store all your passwords in one secure location, making it easy to access them without having to remember each one.
3. **Security**: Password managers encrypt your data, providing a higher level of security than storing passwords in plain text or using simple methods like sticky notes.
4. **Cross-Platform Access**: Many password managers sync across devices, allowing you to access your passwords from your phone, tablet, or computer.
5. **Password Auditing**: They can help you identify weak or reused passwords and prompt you to change them. See [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

As for avoiding built-in password managers in browsers:
1. **Limited Security Features**: Browser-based password managers may not offer the same level of encryption and security features as dedicated password managers.
2. **Vulnerability to Attacks**: If your browser is compromised, your stored passwords could be at risk. Dedicated password managers often have additional security measures in place.
3. **Less Control**: Built-in password managers may not provide as many options for managing and organizing your passwords compared to standalone solutions.
4. **Browser Dependency**: If you switch browsers or devices, you may find it harder to access your passwords if they are tied to a specific browser.
5. **Privacy Concerns**: Some browsers may collect data on your usage, which could be a concern for privacy-conscious users.

Overall, while built-in password managers can be convenient, using a dedicated password manager can provide enhanced security and features that better protect your sensitive information.
